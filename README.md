# KULAY ROSAS ANG BUKAS ðŸŒ¸

A flower pattern made to show personal interest and way to show my support for my bet this election.

**Pink** is a symbol of innocence, the laughter, and a play of little girls. It screams feminity, gentleness and things of the heart, while **flowers** often have their own unique symbolism.

In the Philippines, pink is associated to Leni Robredo and Kiko Pangilinan tandem during the campaign period. A debate between kakampinks and bbm solid supporters are usually can be seen online, attacking kakampinks with their narratives that pink is not and will never be the real color of roses, because they claim red is the original. 

It is funny how trolls online fight and how ridiculous that I almost fight one of them. Pink has now become a symbol for me of hope for a better governance. I tried to incorporate it with my output, by making a own version of pink flowers. It is not exactly looking like a rose, but the idea that it is inspired, while hoping for a fair and clean election on May 9, kept me going. 

As I always say,
*"flower power! girl power!"*

**I believed in WOMAN supremacy.
I belived in PINK supremacy.**
